# Monitoring-a-Financial-Fraud-Detection-Model
This project analyzes the decline of a fraud detection model's accuracy. It identifies that data drift, specifically a shift in user login times and transaction amounts, caused the model to fail. The report recommends retraining the model on new data to adapt to these evolved fraud patterns.
